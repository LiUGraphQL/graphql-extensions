# *graphql-extensions* with *graphql-result-size* extension

This repo contains a version of [graphql-extensions](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-extensions) (v0.0.10) extended with support for measuring the time required by a prototypical result size calculation step (as implemented in [github:LiUGraphQL/graphql-result-size](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/graphql-result-size)).

We have used this extension in a [GraphQL server created for experiments](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/graphql-result-size-experiment/tree/TimAndersson).
